                    <p><strong>What are Cookies?<br>
                    </strong>&bull; &quot;Cookies&quot; are pieces of electronic information (specifically, a string of text) that your browser and your operating system store on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.<br>
                    &bull; Cookies can store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of previous selections or purchases.<br>
                    &bull; Cookies can enhance the user's visit.<br>
                    &bull; The use of cookies is an industry standard-you'll find they are used by most major commercial websites.</p>
                    <p><strong>How We Issue and Use Cookies<br>
                      </strong>&bull; We issue and use cookies to enhance your visit and the services we offer on the sites. The sites consist of thousands of pages of content. We want you to be able to find the information and offers that interest you, as quickly and easily as possible. The use of cookie technology helps us to achieve that objective.<br>
&bull; We issue and use cookies to keep track of the areas of the sites which interest our visitors most. In doing so, we can determine areas of the sites that are most popular and those that are not. Many improvements and updates to the sites are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.<br>
&bull; Visitors to the sites who accept cookies may be presented with targeted messages, offers and ads on the site and via email that we believe would be of value, based on observed preferences.<br>
&bull; If you have registered as a member of the sites and accept cookies, we can tailor your use to your personal preferences, and it is easier and faster to take advantage of the sites' benefits.<br>
&bull; If you have submitted your email address, you may receive targeted messages we believe you will find of value. Remember, you may request to be removed from your email subscription lists.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Choice to Accept or Deny Cookies<br>
                      </strong>You can choose whether to accept or deny cookies; your browser on your computer is often initially set to accept cookies. However, you can choose to deny cookies and continue browsing the sites.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that your choice to accept or deny a cookie is different from your choice to accept/deny email messages.</p>
                    <p class="copyhead">Sharing Personal Information Collected on our Websites</p>
                    <p>We may share personal information among the Hilton Family of Companies, owners and operators of our franchised and managed hotels, and Hilton International Co. We may also share information with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you. From time to time we may partner with other companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, products and services and may share your information with our co-sponsor. For example, we may co-sponsor some sweepstakes or contests on our site with other companies or we may provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes or contests, we may share your information with our co-sponsor or the third party sponsor. When you use a credit card to purchase goods or services, we may share your information with the credit card company. We also may share your information with the banks that issue our Hilton HHonors co-branded credit cards. Use of shared information is subject to third parties' policies.</p>

                      </strong>In the event that Hilton, or part of the Hilton Family of Companies, merges with or is acquired by another legal entity, the personal information collected by Hilton may be transferred to that other legal entity as an asset.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Requirements<br>
                      </strong>The Hilton Family of Companies will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law, or is necessary or desirable to investigate or protect against harmful activities to guests, visitors, employees, or others, or to property (including this site).</p>
