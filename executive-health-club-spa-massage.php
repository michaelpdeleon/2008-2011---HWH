                                30 Minutes &ndash; $45<br>
                                45 Minutes &ndash; $55<br>

                              <p><strong>Swedish</strong><br>
                                This is a classic form of Western massage known for its use of long strokes, kneading, friction and stretching to reduce stress and relax muscles. It aides in muscles recovery from strains by releasing built up lactic and uric acid from muscle tissue. Swedish massage will relax, revitalize and renew your body.</p>
                              <p><strong>Neuromuscular/Deep Tissue</strong><br>
                                This massage uses steady, deep pressure on contracted areas to realign deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue (fascia). The therapist will work to release chronic muscle tension and restore fascia to its healthy state to achieve increased mobility and reduced pain. People suffering from problems such as chronic pain, repetitive 
                              strains or sprains, and muscle tension (including tension headaches) might find this type of massage particularly beneficial.</p>
                              <p><strong>Prenatal</strong><br>
                                Designed with the intention of relieving pain related to pregnancy, prenatal massage reduces sciatic nerve pain and aides in alleviating stress. It is popular for reducing 
                              back pain when medicinal choices may be limited. The expecting mother will lie on her side to provide safety and comfort to both her and her child. Prenatal massage is recommended after the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>
                              <p><strong>Reflexology</strong><br>
                                Reflexology is a foot massage that will serve as a tune-up for your entire body. The basis of this massage is a belief that contained within the feet is a complete map of the body&rsquo;s organs. By applying pressure to different areas on the soles of your feet a therapist is<br>
                              able to extend beneficial effects to different body parts.</p>
                              <p><strong>Reiki</strong><br>
                              A spiritual based practice that involves hand placement over and around the different chakras of the body to harmonize the mind with the body and allow for proper distribution of energy. Reiki massage can be used to send energy to broken bones to facilitate healing. This is a powerful and relaxing treatment for healing.</p>

                              <p><strong>Ortho Bionomy</strong> - $50 (30 min.) or $85 (60 min.)<br>
                                Developed by Dr. Arthur Lincoln Pauls, Ortho-bionomy seeks to create an understanding of the body. The therapist will work with the body instead of forcing change. Ortho-bionomy is used to relieve acute and chronic pain, patterns of chronic tension and stress. It is performed by placing the body and joints in positions of comfort then applying gentle motions and/or compression to result in less pain, reduced tension, greater circulation and flexibility. <em>Recipient will stay fully clothed for the duration of the session.</em></p>
                              <p><strong>Shiatsu</strong> - $50 (30 min.) or $85 (60 min.)<br>
                                Based on the Chinese meridian system, Shiatsu is an Eastern style of massage that uses strategic pressure from the palms and fingers of the therapist to disrupt energy blockages and restore chi to its optimal flow. This type of massage eases stress, improves circulation, and balances chi.</p>
                              <p><strong>Cranio Sacral</strong> - $50 (30 min.) or $85 (60 min.)<br>
                                This treatment uses a gentle touch to move the plates of the skull by working with the pulse of the craniosacral fluid to restore energy balance and relieve tension and stress. Healing is promoted from the inside out where the aim is a return to a more open, calm and graceful way of being. The recipient will stay fully clothed for the duration of the session.</p>
                              <p><strong>Hot Stone</strong> - $90 (60 min.)<br>
Heated, smoothed stones are used in combination with a traditional Swedish massage to provide a deeply relaxing experience. The heat of the stones can aid in the quick release of pressure from the muscles while soothing the body. Placement of stones on the body can help to increase energy flow.</p>
                              <p><strong>Chair Massage </strong> - $20 (15 min.)<br>
                                This is a fifteen minute Swedish massage that focuses on quickly relieving stress and tension by concentrating on the neck, shoulders and back. Chair massage is an ideal massage for a quick break from the office environment or a break from a day of conferences. The recipient will stay fully clothed for the duration of the session. </p>
