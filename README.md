# Description:  
This website was meant to give information about this newly formed research and development laboratory.  It shows the personnel and their publications as well as the type of research they are conducting which hopefully attracts other experts in this field to join their work.  

I mostly oversaw the maintenance and updates to the events section, updated the event calendars and created landing pages to said events.  I also installed and customized a jQuery plugin called prettyPhoto which is a lightbox clone.  It presents pictures and videos with style.
